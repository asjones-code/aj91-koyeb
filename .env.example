# OpenAI API key for the terminal "ask" command (client-side; restrict key by domain in OpenAI dashboard).
#
# Local: copy to .env and set your key, then restart dev server.
#   cp .env.example .env
#   # edit .env: OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
#   npm run dev
#
# Or in shell before starting:
#   export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
#   npm run dev
#
# Koyeb (prod): App → Environment variables → add OPENAI_API_KEY.
# The key is inlined at BUILD time, so it must be available when "npm run build" runs.
# Set scope to "Build" or "Build and Runtime" so the build step can read it.
