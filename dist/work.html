              <h2>Education</h2>
              <p class="page-about-body">I studied political science and French at Middlebury, then later picked up agile project management at Colorado Boulder and data analysis through NYC’s Tech Talent Pipeline—Excel, SQL, Python, and a bit of NLP. The mix of policy, language, and systems has stuck with me.</p>

              <h2>Experience</h2>
              <h3 id="assembled">Implementation Manager, Assembled</h3>
              <p class="page-work-meta">New York, NY · Jan 2025 – Present</p>
              <p class="page-about-body">Assembled builds tools for support teams—scheduling, forecasting, making sense of contact volume. I work on implementations: getting AI-driven workflows into the hands of ops so they can automate a big chunk of tickets instead of triaging by hand. I also built an internal app that pulls data from Salesforce, Zendesk, and other CRMs into one place so we can reconcile and validate without the usual spreadsheet chaos. A lot of the job is rolling out workforce management across enterprise accounts and making sure the numbers actually help people plan their day.</p>
              <h3 id="gotham">IT Project Manager, Gotham Greens</h3>
              <p class="page-work-meta">Brooklyn, NY · Feb 2023 – Jul 2023</p>
              <p class="page-about-body">Gotham Greens grows produce in controlled-environment greenhouses—urban, climate-resilient. I led a small team on analytics, ops, and finance: finding where the data was messy, where processes could be automated, and where better tooling could save real money. We worked closely with Digital Solutions on dozens of IT initiatives—databases, software rollouts, systems that had to work in the greenhouse as well as the office. One of the more satisfying projects was wiring labor data from HRIS into the data warehouse so COGS and efficiency could be tracked properly across sites.</p>
              <h3 id="meta">Implementation Manager, Meta</h3>
              <p class="page-work-meta">New York, NY · Aug 2021 – Feb 2023</p>
              <p class="page-about-body">At Meta I was on the side that helps businesses run their support and messaging at scale. I led implementations of omni-channel CRM for commercial and enterprise clients—getting them from “we have a lot of channels” to “we have one place to see and respond to everything.” I wrote and deployed Salesforce Apex to automate a lot of the project kickoff and tracking so we could start work faster and keep things consistent. A big part of my focus was Spanish-speaking enterprise: translating SOWs and key resources so those teams could onboard and operate without waiting on English-only docs.</p>
              <h3 id="barrel">Solutions Architect, Barrel</h3>
              <p class="page-work-meta">New York, NY · Sept 2020 – Sept 2021</p>
              <p class="page-about-body">Barrel is a digital agency—web builds, strategy, design and engineering in one place. I worked with clients to shape technical approaches that fit their goals and budgets, from small sites to six-figure engagements. One standout was for an FDIC-chartered bank: a large dataset of online account applications was full of noise. I used SQL to clean it, validate it, and get to an accurate count of accounts opened in the quarter so they could report and plan with confidence.</p>
              <h3 id="sendwave">Director of Growth, Sendwave</h3>
              <p class="page-work-meta">Atlanta, GA · Dec 2018 – Feb 2020</p>
              <p class="page-about-body">Sendwave lets people send money to family abroad simply and cheaply. I ran growth: onboarding new users, tuning the funnel, and making sure we showed up where our customers were. We grew users and revenue sharply—Sendwave later joined WorldRemit (Zepz) in a large acquisition, and that growth was part of the story. I also brought in influencer partnerships and other channels to bring cost per acquisition down and keep growth efficient.</p>

              <p class="page-work-meta">Remote · Oct 2023 – Jun 2024</p>
              <p class="page-about-body">Rootwise does real-time monitoring and analysis in the Global South—crises, political risk, things that move fast. I did reporting and analysis so that field teams and decision-makers could see what was happening and adjust quickly. The work was about turning messy, live information into something actionable and, where possible, into better safety and smarter responses on the ground.</p>
