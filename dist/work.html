              <p class="page-about-body">I studied political science and French at Middlebury, exploring language
                acquisition and political philosophy. After several years teaching ESL in Central America—where I earned
                my CELTA—I transitioned into tech in 2018 as a DATA Fellow in NYC’s Tech Talent Pipeline (Excel, SQL,
                Python, NLP). I later completed coursework in Agile Project Management at the University of Colorado
                Boulder. Technology, communication, and natural systems remain the throughline in how I think and build.

              <p class="page-about-body">Assembled builds tools for support teams—scheduling, forecasting, making sense
                of contact volume. I work on implementations: getting AI-driven workflows into the hands of ops so they
                can automate a big chunk of tickets instead of triaging by hand. I also built an internal app that pulls
                data from Salesforce, Zendesk, and other CRMs into one place so we can reconcile and validate without
                the usual spreadsheet chaos. A lot of the job is rolling out workforce management across enterprise
                accounts and making sure the numbers actually help people plan their day.</p>

              <p class="page-about-body">Gotham Greens grows produce in controlled-environment greenhouses—urban,
                climate-resilient. I led a small team on analytics, ops, and finance: finding where the data was messy,
                where processes could be automated, and where better tooling could save real money. We worked closely
                with Digital Solutions on dozens of IT initiatives—databases, software rollouts, systems that had to
                work in the greenhouse as well as the office. One of the more satisfying projects was wiring labor data
                from HRIS into the data warehouse so COGS and efficiency could be tracked properly across sites.</p>

              <p class="page-about-body">At Meta I was on the side that helps businesses run their support and messaging
                at scale. I led implementations of omni-channel CRM for commercial and enterprise clients—getting them
                from “we have a lot of channels” to “we have one place to see and respond to everything.” I wrote and
                deployed Salesforce Apex to automate a lot of the project kickoff and tracking so we could start work
                faster and keep things consistent. A big part of my focus was Spanish-speaking enterprise: translating
                SOWs and key resources so those teams could onboard and operate without waiting on English-only docs.

              <p class="page-about-body">Barrel is a digital agency—web builds, strategy, design and engineering in one
                place. I worked with clients to shape technical approaches that fit their goals and budgets, from small
                sites to six-figure engagements. One standout was for an FDIC-chartered bank: a large dataset of online
                account applications was full of noise. I used SQL to clean it, validate it, and get to an accurate
                count of accounts opened in the quarter so they could report and plan with confidence.</p>

                growth: onboarding new users, tuning the funnel, and making sure we showed up where our customers were.
                We grew users and revenue sharply—Sendwave later joined WorldRemit (Zepz) in a large acquisition, and
                that growth was part of the story. I also brought in influencer partnerships and other channels to bring
                cost per acquisition down and keep growth efficient.</p>
